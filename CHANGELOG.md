# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- `fable-trigger.py` read the playbook from a hardcoded `/Users/ak/...` path, so
  on-demand injection silently failed for everyone but the original author. It now
  resolves `~/.claude/FABLE_PLAYBOOK.md`.
- `test-after-edit.py` was a silent no-op on Windows — the `npm`/`pnpm`/`yarn`/
  `make` shims raised `FileNotFoundError`. It now resolves the runner via
  `shutil.which` and runs through `cmd.exe` on Windows. Also dropped a duplicate
  `.lockb` skip entry.

### Added
- **One-command, cross-platform installer** (`install.py`) for Windows, macOS, and
  Linux. `install.sh` / `install.ps1` are thin wrappers that exec it.
- PowerShell launcher (`shell/fable.ps1`) alongside the zsh one.
- `uninstall.py` (+ `.sh` / `.ps1` wrappers) — surgical reversal of the install:
  removes bundled files, strips the launcher line, drops only the Fable hooks from
  `settings.json`; leaves user skills, unrelated hooks, and `~/.claude` intact.
- pytest suite for both hooks and the installer; GitHub Actions CI across
  ubuntu/macos/windows × Python 3.9 and 3.12.
- `.gitattributes` (LF for shell/Python, CRLF for PowerShell), `.editorconfig`,
  `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and this changelog.

### Changed
- `merge_settings.py` writes the absolute interpreter (`sys.executable`) and
  absolute hook paths into `settings.json`, so the hooks fire without `$HOME` or
  `python3` resolution at hook-run time.
- Unified the project owner to **HalalifyMusic** in `LICENSE` and `README`.
- Removed a dead `CONNECTORS.md` link in the `explore-data` skill.

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Initial fable-mode bundle: the Fable 5 system prompt (`fable-system.md`), the
  `FABLE_PLAYBOOK.md` execution playbook, the `fable-trigger` / `test-after-edit`
  hooks, the `/ground` skill and `grounding-verifier` agent, bundled
  design/testing/MCP skills, and the `fable` zsh launcher.
